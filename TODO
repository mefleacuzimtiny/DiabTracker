Todo:
1. Design UI
    o Add new record (foating "+" button throughout the entire UI, appends record to csv file) (Create)
    o View history
        1. Read history from CSV file into vector of Records (Read)
        2. Delete history record Record.delete (Delete)
        3. Edit history record (Update)
    o Show stats charts
4. Design the statistical analysis features (i.e regression analysis)
    o Show a graph of the values against time (scatterplot)
    0 Show regression line on the scatterplot
    o Show if the current diabetes value is bad or good by determining how far out of the normal range it is
    o Show average time between
    o Show if the gradient of line (linear regression) within a certain datetime range is good
        o if it is closer to zero, then that is good... if it is declining, that is bad
